 📖 Project Overview
This project was built to practice frontend skills, especially layout and responsiveness. The goal was to closely match Spotify’s homepage while only using HTML and CSS — no JavaScript or libraries.

It helped me:

-Understand layout building from scratch

-Practice Flexbox and Grid deeply

-Focus on UI/UX consistency and spacing

-Get better with real-world design replication
